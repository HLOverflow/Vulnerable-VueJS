# Vulnerable-VueJS
This is a repository to study attack surface of VueJS. 

Many articles online talked about VueJS vulnerabilities in lengthy and wordly sentences with little example codes. Here, I aim to provide short and simple PoC codes for educational purpose.

1. Cross-Side Scripting (XSS)
2. Client-side Template Injection (CSTI)
3. URL Injection / Open Redirect
